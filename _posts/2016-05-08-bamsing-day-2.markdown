# Day 2
Hi, My name is Pontus Lindgren @happypwn on Twitter.
I'm 2 Days in on finishing this prototype of my game [Bamsing](http://bamsing.com).


# What did I do on Day 2?
I iterated upon my color scheme.

<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:calc(100% / 1.78)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/FailingIckyBorderterrier' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The way I went about things was setting up a [mood board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_board) like this one:

I recently watched Ronia and Princess Mononoke by Studio Ghibli and felt inspired by the vivid colors in their artwork. So a simple Google search for some images and I have my inspiration.

After that its just a matter of tweaking everything you see in your scene until you *feel* that its nice.

Even though I focused on the title screen I think it works great in gameplay as well.

See you tomorrow!
