# Who am I?
Hi!

My name is Pontus Lindgren. I am starting up my Game development company Kirikoro Studios. And this is an article series about me doing that at The Game Incubator in Gothenburg, Sweden.

You can read more about what The Game Incubator is and does in [this post!](/incubator-life-001)

## Visit from Paul
A few days ago my good friend Paul @LowenAberg decided to visit us at The Game Incubator(If you wanna come too just ask!). We had some pizza, some coffee and then went around and said hi to everybody. We had so much fun that we forgot to document it with a picture, so here's one of Paul I stole from the internet.

Paul is currently going to the University of Sk√∂vde where he's studying Gamewriting, which he has done a lot of for in this months Humble Original Copoka!

"Copoka is an mellow open world exploratory indie game about a bird in a totalitarian city state, created by Inaccurate Interactive."

Paul has been writing a lot of the stories you can hear and learn about when you fly around the totalitarian city in this game. I think it's really cool. And make sure you [get the monthly humble bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/monthly) before it runs out at 19:00 CEST today, because otherwise you wont get Copoka!

## Connections
I think the best resource I have as a microscopic indiestudio in an incubator is my contacts. And visits like these is one of the best ways to cultivate those contacts, you get to learn from each other, know about what is happening and probably a lot more valueable things I didnt notice.

I personally got some really cool tips about my game and how I can write gamedesign documents with a publisher in mind instead of game developers, I believe this will help a lot if and when I'll be looking to make a contact like that.

So what I'm going to take with me from this post is, Buy the Humble Monthly :D, and cultivate you contact net!
