# Day 4
Hi, My name is Pontus Lindgren @happypwn on Twitter.
I'm 4 Days in on [finishing this prototype](/bamsing-prototype) of my game [Bamsing](http://bamsing.com).


# What did I do on Day 4?
Today I put the finishing gameplay elements of the tutorial that's integrated into gameplay. The part you see here is optional!

<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:calc(100% / 1.78)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/NeglectedCriminalCottontail' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
After this part comes the more fun part where I get to challenge the player and
create some problem solving that will be fun to deal with. Action-fights, puzzle's and more.

See you tomorrow!

# How can you help?
You can help by providing feedback, I would love to hear absolutely any thoughts you have about the game.
