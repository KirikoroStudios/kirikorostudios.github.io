A cool Action-Adventure game with a focus on better action and innovative puzzle mechanics that will bring a breath of fresh air into the genre.

# Why a prototype in 3 weeks?

I recently started my company in a business incubator program called The Game Incubator in Gothenburg.
In 3 weeks The Game Incubator has arranged for Player Research to come to our offices. So, by that time
I need my prototype to be fully featured for Player Research to test and give feedback on.
