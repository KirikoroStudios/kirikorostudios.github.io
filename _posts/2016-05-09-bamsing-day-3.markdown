# Day 3
Hi, My name is Pontus Lindgren @happypwn on Twitter.
I'm 3 Days in on [finishing this prototype](/bamsing-prototype) of my game [Bamsing](http://bamsing.com).


# What did I do on Day 3?
Today I added more content, in the form of level, story and a tutorial

<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:calc(100% / 1.78)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ShorttermChubbyFrog' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The hard thing about level design, story and characters is that you have to implement it in a way
that feels natural to the player. If you want to drive the story forward you might want to use a
certain character to tell that story point. But it also has to *make sense* for that character to say those thing.
Therefore you have to create personalities, backstories and more so you can really get to know these characters.
And if you do these things properly soon you'll have an alive and explorable world.
 Which I think brings a lot of value to an adventure game.

And I am also putting in a lot of weight into teaching the player basic game mechanics by incorporating those
lessons into the story arch. Rather than have a big "TUTORIAL" menu choice in the beginning. I think its turning out good,
but I'll have to let someone test it so I can know what needs to be fixed.

See you tomorrow!
