A cool Action-Adventure game called <a href="bamsing.com">Bamsing</a> with a focus on better action and innovative puzzle mechanics that will bring a breath of fresh air into the genre.

I recently started my company in a business incubator program called The Game Incubator in Gothenburg.
In 3 weeks, around 26th or 27th of May. The Game Incubator has arranged for One of the best game Q&A companies around, Player Research, to come to our offices and test all the projects in The Game Incubator. So by that time I need my prototype to be fully featured for Player Research to test and give feedback on.
