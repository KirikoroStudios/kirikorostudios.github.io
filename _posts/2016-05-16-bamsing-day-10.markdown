# Day 10
Hi, My name is Pontus Lindgren @happypwn on Twitter.
I'm 10 Days in on [finishing this prototype](/bamsing-prototype) of my game [Bamsing](http://bamsing.com).

# What did I do on Day 10?
Today I built a mechanic for when the player falls of a platform or if the player uses the gravity shift mechanic to launch themselves into space or the horizon.

So now I have my basic mechanics to be able to test the puzzle mechanics I had in mind. And after testing it I feel like I have some problems.
For one it's very hard to determine where you will land when you do a gravity shift from "top to bottom". So there I feel I might need to find a more natural way for the player
to choose where to go. The mechanic I have now is also sort of all encompassing. There are not a lot of mechanics that can complement it, since it controls so much of the "world".
I'm going to have to think a lot about how I go forward and try to tackle these problems. But it's really fun to get challenged by your game development!
