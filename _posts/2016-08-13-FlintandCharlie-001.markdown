# Flint and Charlie news!
Hi!

I've been hard at work on [Flint and Charlie](http://flintandcharlie.com) the last month and sometime in the next week(s) I will put the game up on Steam Greenlight. This means there will be a Gameplay preview trailer which I have put together with the help of you who [signed up for the beta](http://goo.gl/forms/abKSefkEKr0f9fIU2). I really look forward to showing all of you what I've been making and I hope you'll provide me with some great feedback!

Enjoy this pic of me looking all goofy infront of my workstation at home:

## Gamescom
I wont, but Flint and Charlie will be at Gamescom this year. Flint and Charlie will be at the Sweden Game Arena booth:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="sv"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Write down: Hall 4.1 stand C25!

Just ask find the booth at Hall 4.1 stand C25 and ask for Fredrik, he will hook you up with a playtest!

## Future plan
After I have finished the demo that will be used at Gamescom and the Gameplay preview trailer me and Fredrik(My business coach) are going to sit down and make a plan for the following months and that will involve a lot more coverage of development. So stay tuned and dont forget to share your thoughts with me so we can make Flint and Charlie more awesomer together!
