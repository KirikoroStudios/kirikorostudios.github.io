# Day 7
Hi, My name is Pontus Lindgren @happypwn on Twitter.
I'm 7 Days in on [finishing this prototype](/bamsing-prototype) of my game [Bamsing](http://bamsing.com).

# What did I do on Day 7?
[Yesterday](/bamsing-day-6) I got a tip from a reddit-user [/u/pheonix2105](https://www.reddit.com/user/pheonix2105) about how I could implement a way to visually help the player
choose which direction the character will gravitate towards. Thanks <3.

I immediately recognized it as an awesome idea and today I implemented a version of this lovely individuals idea!

So what you see below is the player is currently using the "choose gravitational direction item" by holding down a button, which at first just displays the current flow of gravitation(it also zooms out for better clarity!).

Then the player can
use the left analog stick to specify which way they want the gravitation to flow. After releasing the "choose gravitational direction item"-button, the gravity changes in the direction that the particles are flying. (Go full screen on the gif to see it in action!)

Here I am just holding down the button and testing different directions before I've made my choice:

<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:calc(100% / 1.78)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/SelfassuredUnderstatedAdeliepenguin' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

And can you guess what happens when I release the "choose gravitational direction item"-button? The gravity shifts!

<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:calc(100% / 1.78)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/AnxiousImportantAcornwoodpecker' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

So, my "takeaways" from this is that even thought its hard to get feedback from the internet when I get some its usually very good advice! And thanks everyone who take their time to actually
help me with this. I hope I can somehow repay you, and if you think I can, don't hesitate to contact me!

# How can you help?
You can help by providing feedback, I would love to hear absolutely any thoughts you have about the game.
